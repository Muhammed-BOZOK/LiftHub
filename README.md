# LiftHub

LiftHub is a mobile initiative that prioritizes gender equality as one of the primary sustainable development goals. Our objectives at LiftHub include:

- Creating educational support videos on discrimination, harassment, and awareness.
- Developing a location-based voting system to gauge public opinion.
